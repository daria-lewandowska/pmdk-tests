This module includes tests for PMDK rpm installation.

Tests check:
-compatibility of the version of installed rpm packages from PMDK library with
 the current version of PMDK library,
-if all rpm packages from PMDK library are installed.

Required arguments:
-r <PMDK_path>    the PMDK library root path.
